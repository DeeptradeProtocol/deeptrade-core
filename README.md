# Deeptrade Core

## Overview

This package is a **comprehensive on-chain trading protocol suite** built to enhance and secure liquidity operations on the Sui network's DeepBook order book.

A core design principle is extending DeepBook's capabilities without sacrificing composability. This approach ensures users can freely manage orders created via the protocol using native DeepBook operations, preventing platform lock-in and granting full autonomy over their trading activity.

Crucially, this design also preserves the security of the underlying DeepBook protocol. The protocol does not take custody of user orders or assets; it only manages the fees generated through its usage.

This significantly minimizes risk for end users, even if the protocol were to cease operations, users would retain uninterrupted control and could continue managing their orders and assets directly on DeepBook.

Deeptrade Core introduces a self-sustaining economic model centered around a core **Treasury** that manages protocol-owned liquidity for `DEEP` tokens. This allows for a more accessible trading experience by abstracting the native fee token requirements of the underlying order book.

The protocol's key innovation is its robust **Fee and Liquidity Management Engine**, which includes:

- **Dynamic Fee Generation**: A configurable fee engine that generates protocol revenue from trading activity. It allows for distinct taker/maker rates, which can be set independently based on the fee type used (DEEP or Input Coin). This flexibility is crucial for incentivizing the use of the `DEEP` token, thereby strengthening the protocol's economic model.
- **Unsettled Fees System**: A fair and scalable mechanism that ensures fees are only charged on executed trade volumes, utilizing per-user `FeeManager` objects to prevent **shared object contention** and ensure the protocol remains highly scalable.
- **Oracle-Secured Pricing**: A dual-validation system that leverages both on-chain pool data and external Pyth oracle feeds to protect the protocol's reserves from atomic price manipulation attacks.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The protocol is designed with gas efficiency as a key consideration. By optimizing on-chain storage and computation, transaction costs are minimized for users, ensuring a more cost-effective trading experience.
- **DEEP Token Utility**: The protocol creates strong utility for the `DEEP` token. For accessibility, the Treasury's DEEP Reserves cover DeepBook fees on behalf of users, who then repay the protocol with a market-rate coverage fee in SUI. To incentivize holding `DEEP`, users who cover DeepBook fees with their own `DEEP` tokens pay no coverage fee and also receive substantial discounts on protocol fees.
- **User Incentives**: An integrated Loyalty Program that rewards high-volume traders with fee discounts, encouraging sustained platform activity.

Governance and security are paramount, enforced through an **on-chain Multisig Guarantee** that hardcodes multi-signature verification into all sensitive administrative functions.

High-risk operations, such as withdrawals from the protocol's treasury and fee updates, are further protected by a mandatory, event-logged **Timelock System**. This system is designed with two key goals: to provide users with full transparency and a response window for changes that could affect them, such as fee increases, and to adding security layer for the protocol by safeguarding treasury reserves against unauthorized withdrawals.

The protocol is designed for long-term maintainability with a built-in **Versioning System**, allowing for secure and seamless upgrades.

To further enhance transparency around upgrades, the protocol will adopt a **Custom Upgrade Policy** for its `UpgradeCap`. This initiative directly addresses the critical need for observable package upgrades â€” a challenge recognized within the broader Sui ecosystem (see [Sui Improvement Proposal #57](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/pull/57/files)). The custom policy, currently in draft (see [PR #75](https://github.com/DeeptradeProtocol/deeptrade-core/pull/75)), will provide essential on-chain visibility for any upgrade event. This lays the groundwork for a future upgrade timelock, ensuring the community has a crucial window to review and react to changes, safeguarding against unauthorized modifications.

## Fee overview

### Order Fees

DeepBook protocol requires paying fees for order placement in either DEEP or the order's input asset (DEEP-based fee or Input Coin fee types), with fees calculated based on order price and size. Deeptrade protocol extends this flexibility by allowing users to pay these fees using various sources: their wallet, their `BalanceManager`, or even the protocol's treasury DEEP reserves if the user's DEEP balance is insufficient.

**Protocol Fees**: In addition to DeepBook's fees, the Deeptrade charges its own protocol fees. These fees can be configured with different rates for taker and maker orders, and can be set globally or on a per-pool basis.
For detailed information about dynamic protocol fee calculation, and the unsettled fees mechanism, see the [Fee Design](docs/fee-design.md) and [Unsettled Fees](docs/unsettled-fees.md) documentation.

**DEEP Reserve Coverage Fee**: This fee is charged only when a user borrows `DEEP` from the protocol's reserves to cover DeepBook fees. It is paid in SUI and is equivalent to the market value of the `DEEP` provided. More information is available in the [Treasury DEEP Reserves](docs/treasury_deep_reserves.md).

#### Protocol Fee Discounts

When using DEEP fee type, users can receive discounts on protocol fees based on how much DeepBook fees they cover with their own DEEP tokens. The more DEEP the user provides, the higher their discount on protocol fees.
Whitelisted pools receive the maximum protocol fee discount rate for each order. The discount rates are per-pool based and set in `TradingFeeConfig`, with a default rate of 25% used if not specified.

Additionally, the system includes a **Loyalty Program** that provides additional protocol fee discounts based on user loyalty levels. For detailed information about the loyalty program, see the [Loyalty Program](docs/loyalty.md).

## Swap Fees

Similar to order fees, the DeepBook protocol requires paying fees for swaps in either `DEEP` or the swap's input coin (DEEP-based or Input Coin fee types), calculated based on the swap size.

Deeptrade charges its own fees using the `taker_fee` parameter specified in `TradingFeeConfig`. For swaps, the protocol currently only supports the Input Coin fee type.

The protocol fee is charged in the output coin of the swap.
Discounts from the [Loyalty Program](docs/loyalty.md) also apply to swap fees.
