/// factor (`FLOAT_SCALING_U128`).

///
///   (x * y) / z  =  ((A*S) * (B*S)) / (C*S)
///                =  (A * B * S * S) / (C * S)
///                =  (A * B / C) * S
///
/// The result is the correctly scaled representation of `A * B / C`. This method is also
/// highly precise because it performs multiplication before division, minimizing rounding errors.
